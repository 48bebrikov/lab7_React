# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Tasks
- Implement a UI Kit Mui/Bootstrap or the like into the project for adaptability.
- Implement Header (Home, About yourself) - separate pages.
- Change the theme to dark in the Header.
- To bring the user profile into the Mui/Bootstrap library standard
- Implement Menu (Drawer/Slider) - The menu should still open the list of labs, but it should be hidden and called from the Header using the icon button.
- In the lower menu, organize a quick action call (feedback, etc.)
* Check that the application has become adaptive for different devices.
- Post the lab work to the github repository as a separate commit
- Attach a link to the project as a text
